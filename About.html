<p>Referred to as the Hawaii of Korea, Jeju Do is categorized as a sub-tropic volcanic island, located off the southern tip of the South Korean mainland. 
Jeju is known for its Eco Tourism and is home to breath taking coastlines, volcanic caves, lush forests and fairytale like waterfalls. 
 It has long been the country’s favourite domestic holiday.
 <img src="\gcproject\abt1.jpg" width="450" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;"><br>There’s plenty on Jeju-do to appeal to those who prefer to be active. Hike up South Korea’s highest mountain, Halla-san, or climb the incredible tuff cone Seongsan Ilchul-bong, rising straight from the sea, to watch the sun rise from the ridge of a crater.
 For a less-demanding nature experience, meander along one of the Jeju Olle Trails and explore tangerine-trimmed country roads, jagged coasts and narrow lanes dotted with cottage-style homes made from black lava rock. 
 The ocean is never far away, so plunge into blue seas to view coral as colourful as the sunsets and dig into Jeju-do’s unique cuisine, including seafood caught by haeneyo (female free divers).

 <h2 style="font-size:50">Formation</h2> 
  <ul>
<li>About 2 million years ago, the island of Jeju was formed through volcanic activity.</li>
 <li>About 1.2 million years ago, a magma chamber formed under the sea floor and began to erupt.</li>
 <li>About 700 thousand years ago, the island had been formed through volcanic activity. Volcanic activity then stopped for approximately 100 thousand years.</li>
 <li>About 300 thousand years ago, volcanic activity restarted along the coastline.</li>
 <li>About 100 thousand years ago, volcanic activity formed Halla Mountain.</li><img src="\gcproject\abt2.jpg" width="300" height="200" style="float: right; margin-right: 15px;">
<li> About 25 thousand years ago, lateral eruptions around Halla Mountain left multiple oreum (smaller 'parasitic' cones on the flanks of the primary cone).</li>
 <li>Volcanic activity stopped and prolonged weathering and erosion helped shape the island.</li>

</ul>
<p>Jeju Island was designated a National Biosphere conservation area in 2002, a World Natural Heritage site in 2007, and received Global Geopark Network certification in 2010. It is the only area in the world that has achieved these three accolades at the same time. 
One of the most popular surfing spots in Korea, Jeju Island is also the birthplace of Korean surfing. Some famous beaches are Weoljung Beach and Jungmun Beach. The latter is home to the first surfing club in Korea, established in 1995.
There are small islands near Jeju Island that visitors can visit by boat; the most famous of these are Udo, Gapado, and Marado. Udo is famous for its peanut ice cream and boat tours.
Jeju became more well known outside Korea after two characters in the 2021 Netflix original series Squid Game mentioned it. It was also the location for two episodes of the 2022 Netflix original series Extraordinary Attorney Woo, entitled "The Blue Night of Jeju I and II".</p>
