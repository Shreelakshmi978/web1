<h1 style="font-size:50; background-color:grey">Transportation in Jeju</h1>
<p>   In Jeju Island, there are various types of transportation options- bus, taxi, car, motorcycle/scooters, and bikes– 
and each type offers its own unique travel experiences. Since there are no trains or subway in Jeju Island, buses 
and taxis are the two main public transportation on the island.</p>
<p>   In 2017, the provincial government completely revised and expanded the public bus system to make it bigger,
 better, and easier to use. Buses and bus stops are equipped with free, stable WiFi, and many bus stops on the
island also have touch-screen displays showing you the current status of the buses en route. There are several 
bus apps you can download, like the free real-time bus app provided by the Jeju Special Self-Governing Province
 which has options for Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese. KakaoMap is another great app with a real-time
 bus layer with services provided in Korean and English.
